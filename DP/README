A Node Class:
  *Need to know if leaf
  	*assosiated reward
  *empty assosiated reward (until analysis)
  *is action
  *if not action assosiated probabilites with next nodes
  * children for tree

How to find rewards and costs:

    costs:
	what is the cost of using up a timestep?
    	cost = E(value setting dist) - max(seen) ???

    reward:
	reward if maximize = max(seen)
    	reward explore = E(value) + value(adding to seen set)





None Decision Tree algorithim (get this into C++ code?):


At time 0 explore:

for t after 0:
    if max(seen) > E(value setting dist):
       maximize
    else:
       explore


The actual Goal:

f(T, M, a, b) = the index at which it is best to change stratgey
or i such that max(E(sum_t=i(v_i)))

Where T is total timesteps
M is total number of states
a is min value over uniform
b is max value over uniform
